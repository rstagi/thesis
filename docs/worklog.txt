Analyzed bytecode instrumentation provided by JVMTI. Some interesting methods may be used to instrument our classes/functions of interest, such as:
 - RedefineClasses and RetransformClasses: allow to change the bytecode of some classes (and so, of the methods) in order to add some new instructions. The problem is how to manipulate the bytecode, it seems quite uncomfortable using C/C++.

- SetNativeMethodPrefix: to be used together with previous method, to instrument native functions. With the previous method we redefine the native function in order to change name, adding a prefix, which will be then notified to the JVM using this function. In this way we can create a wrapper.
